# Matchbox Keyboard Mapping Tool

## Overview
The Matchbox Keyboard Mapping Tool is a web-based tool we developed to reverse map keyboard PCBs faster as we have to adapt our Matchboxes to many different keyboard models.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the website.
3. Modify the `css/styles.css` file to change the styles as needed.
4. Update the `js/scripts.js` file to add or modify interactivity.

## Usage
1. Enter the number of pins on the keyboard PCB in the input field and click "Confirm" to generate the table.
2. Click on a pin button to highlight the corresponding log cell and enter log data.
3. When you're done logging all the pins, click on "Compile table" to compile the mapping table
4. Use the "Export log data" button to save the log data to a JSON file.
5. Use the "Load log data" button to load log data from a JSON file.
